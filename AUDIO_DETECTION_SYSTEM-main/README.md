# Fake Audio Detection System
## Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based system for detecting fake audio. The system utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify audio spectrograms as either real or fake. Fake audio refers to artificially generated or manipulated audio, while real audio represents genuine recordings.

## Features
Audio Preprocessing: Raw audio files are preprocessed to extract spectrograms, which capture the frequency content of the audio signals over time.

Model Training: A CNN model is trained using real and fake audio spectrograms to learn the characteristics of each class.

Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on a separate dataset to assess its performance in detecting fake audio.

Metrics Computation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and loss are computed to measure the model's performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of real and fake audio recordings. It includes a variety of audio samples, including both real-world recordings and artificially generated or manipulated audio.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture used for this project consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers. The final layers include fully connected layers with sigmoid activation for binary classification.

## Dependencies
Python 3.x

TensorFlow

NumPy

librosa

matplotlib

pydub

## Usage
Data Preparation: Organize your real and fake audio files into separate directories.

Data Loading: Load the audio files and preprocess them to extract spectrograms.

Model Training: Train the CNN model using the preprocessed audio spectrograms.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on a separate dataset to assess its performance.

Metrics Calculation: Compute metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and loss to measure the model's performance.

## Results
The performance of the fake audio detection system is evaluated based on the achieved metrics. The system's ability to accurately classify real and fake audio is assessed using various evaluation techniques.

## Future Improvements
Incorporate more advanced deep learning architectures for improved performance.

Explore additional features or data augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness.

Experiment with different preprocessing methods to optimize model training.
